12) Create the "bug_report.json" file via github web
Open repo the page - https://github.com/Anatr0p/JSON
Click "Add file"
Click "Create new file"
Fill the name form on the top-right corner - JSON/bug_report.json

13) Commit new file
Scroll down, fill the commit info, left branch settings untouched to commit to main branch and click "Commit new file"

14) Change the file content in JSON format and commit it
All the same as in 12 and 13

15) Sync remote repo with the local one on pc

check the current JSON folder content on the PC
ls
got only new, preferences and skills json files

git pull

now we can see the bug_report.json file added to our JSON PC folder

That's all about JSON one
XML and TXT I'll make identically, but with git remore rename upstream to change working repo for pushes

XML format:
<1>
	<1_1>text</1_1>
	<1_2>text</1_2>
</1>

At the end we got the next repos:
https://github.com/Anatr0p/JSON
https://github.com/Anatr0p/TXT
https://github.com/Anatr0p/XML
